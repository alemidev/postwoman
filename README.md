# PostWoman
A CLI api tester and request builder, compatible with Postman collection format

## Why
Since newer postman requires registration to use most useful features, I decided to build my own tool reusing their format, to be compatible with my coworkers' collections.
Also, I'd much rather use a CLI tool than a bundled webpage.
